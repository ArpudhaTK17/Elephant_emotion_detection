# Elephant_emotion_detection
Evolutionary interconnection of voice production, acoustic output, and function makes
it necessary to understand basic sound production mechanisms when studying 
animal communication. Unlocking the emotional language of  elephants, this project 
involves the application of signal processing methods such as the Fast Fourier Transform, 
Butterworth filters, and machine learning techniques that encompass decision trees
and random forest classifiers for emotion detection in the vocalization of elephants.
Visualizing audio signals and presenting results with converted labels offer
a unique insight into the emotional world of elephants.
